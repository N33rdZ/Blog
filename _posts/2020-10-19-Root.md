You can also use your rooted phone as Wifi Repeater, also here is many things you can do with rooted device:

# Steps
First approach is easy try one of these applications:
[KingoRoot](https://www.oneclickroot.com/download/)
[farmaroot](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/framaroot/root-framaroot-one-click-apk-to-root-t2130276)
[Kingroot](https://kingroot.en.uptodown.com/android)

Second way is using [TWRP](https://twrp.me/about/) and [magisk](https://magiskmanager.com/)

To do that first we need to prepare some things:

1) Stock rom for device or using (spflash tool or Miracle box) to read your installed rom and get recovery & boot from it
2) Mediatek USB VCOM DRIVERS
3) adb and fastboot and it's usb drivers

## OEM Unlocking
OEM stands for `original equipment manufacturer`. In the smartphone industry, this term refers to companies who manufacture their own phones in their own factories, you can read more here [OEM unlocking](http://helpto.pro/whats-an-oem-unlock-in-android/)

so first we need to enter developer options and switch on `USB Debugging` and `OEM unlocking`
here is a video with Drivers and tools provided

Note the this may void your warranty

after anlocking the bootloader let's start rooting


## Using Get TWRP
to install TWRP you can download an recovery image from here [Devices](https://twrp.me/Devices/)
If your Device is not listed you can use this amazing tool [TWRP Porter](https://forum.hovatek.com/thread-21839.html)

Follow the steps using your original recovery image (from Step 1) above

## Disable dm_verity
While you are getting your TWRP you if you faced dm_verity to know more about it read this [DM Verity](https://blog.hovatek.com/dm_verity-is-probably-why-that-twrp-flash-ends-in-a-bootloop/)

to disable it in my case i used Magisk
First i Opened Magisk (with my `boot.img` from step 1) copied in my device
then i choosed my `boot.img` file to patch and copied the output to my laptop 

Now i booted my Device into Bootloader and then used these command:
`fastboot flash boot patched_boot.img`

here is a Full tut with video:
[patch boot.img](https://forum.hovatek.com/thread-21427.html)

then is flashed my recovery image (from above step) using
`fastboot flash recovery twrp.img`

now I can finally install my `SuperSu`

## Install SuperSu
The **su** or "substitute user" binary allows users to be root user.
Download the Stable Version from [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/supersu/stable-2016-09-01supersu-v2-78-release-t3452703)

then flash it using the TWRP recovery which you already installed 

after that install the apk from [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/codingcode/supersu/supersu-2-82-sr5-release/)

and congratulations You Got your Device Rooted

I want to tell that their is many ways maybe harder or easier, it depends on the devices you can root your devices without TWRP recovery [here](https://forum.hovatek.com/thread-21427.html)
but it didn't work for me, Thanks for reading and I hope it can help you.
