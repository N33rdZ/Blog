# Forensics

### Forensics 1

First i got an `mp3` sound file called `9923.mp3`
When I listened to it i got nothing so i started with looking into it's meta data using `exiftool`

![f1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89761652-2752d400-daef-11ea-8de9-913ae218170a.png)

I noticed that there is a picture inside this file so i extracted it using `Binwalk`

![f1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89761551-eb1f7380-daee-11ea-9047-41d582733d2a.png)

so I got a new files contains `png` file , after using `stegsolve` i got the flag in filter `red plane1`

![f1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89761793-7a2c8b80-daef-11ea-84cb-999438b77fe5.png)

## Forensics 2

I got an `oop` sound file called `5e33f92788d3a8.oop` using also `exiftool` I noticed a comment says `password?` and a hash in `Composer`

![f2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89762055-f6bf6a00-daef-11ea-8927-d010f8ebc336.png)

so i used [Hash Analyzer](https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/) which confirmed that it's an md5 hash

so I have cracked it using [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) and got the value `passwd1999ml`

which was the flag

## forensics 3

we got a `txt` file called `C09NDHFEK343DD3.txt` contains weird text First thing got into my mind that it's `base64`

so after decodeing it I realised that it's `png` file using [File Signiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures)

So I wrote simple script to extract the image file 

```python
import base64

f = open('C09NDHFEK343DD3.txt').read()

f = base64.b64decode(f)

x =open('out.png','wb')

x.write(f)
x.close()
```

the `out.png` file was empty picture so I used `stegsolve` again and i found Encoded text in filter `Red plane 0`

![f3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89762775-66822480-daf1-11ea-937f-a93812f66f18.png)

it was a `Pigpen` ciphered text so I used [Characters Mapping](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/737534876456122647/)

to translate it so I got the flag `HACKERSACADEMY{PENGUINS_ARE_CUTE}`

# Reverse Engineering 

i really Joined late so I started with the easy one
## re2 (First Blood)

I got an `ELF` file called `m26Basic` and output `MTPHTIPCKHPXJWTATOQEPHSREMQEOI`

After Opening it with `Ghidra` I got the code in the Decompiler 
![r2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25514920/89763508-f4aada80-daf2-11ea-846c-fb667dc62c7e.png)

the Encryption method is Easy its just transferring each character of the flag using this equation :
`aiStack184[local_c] = aiStack184[local_c] % 0x19 + 0x41;`

But this puts 4 possibilities for each Character if we are going to bruteforce it,

So I created Frequency array to Analyze the output 

```python
import string
enc = 'MTPHTIPCKHPXJWTATOQEPHSREMQEOI'
m = {}
flag = ''
for i in enc:
    m[i] = []
    for x in string.printable:
        if chr((ord(x) % 0x19) + 65) == i:
            m[i].append(x)
            flag += x
print(m)
```

I noticed that its always make sense when we use UpperCase Characters without the `Z` so i bruteforced overthem and got the flag

```python
import string
enc = 'MTPHTIPCKHPXJWTATOQEPHSREMQEOI'
m = {}
flag = ''
for i in enc:
    m[i] = []
    for x in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY':
        if chr((ord(x) % 0x19) + 65) == i:
            m[i].append(x)
            flag += x
#print(m)
print(flag)
```
which was `HACKERSACADEMY{WEARESAMURAITHEKEYBOARDCOWBOYS}`

# Web

## web 3 by Ebrahim.Mosaad

* Description:
```
Introducing our secure DNS lookup service! This one uses the dig command provided in linux to provide the most accurate results!

And don't you worry about attacks, we've got that all "quoted" up!
```

The Website was using `dig` to to DNS lookup and returns the result 

the first thing got into my mind is using the single quotes to execute another command and get the flag 

but when ever i use single `quotes` or `spaces` or any thin is not a letter , the whole input will be quoted, For ex:

test -> dig test
test`space` -> dig 'test '
test' -> dig 'test'"'"''

so I wanted to understand how this filter warks and i found it in [stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250079/how-to-escape-single-quotes-within-single-quoted-strings)

So i knew it's mpossible to bypass it, the second thing got into my mind is inputing a parameter to dig command [Dig](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig)

I didn't know that the `space` is also making the input rounded with single quotes,

So I spent Alot of time thinking in anotherway to solve it until my friend [Ahmed Sherif](https://www.facebook.com/AhmedS93) told me that the arguments doesn't need spaces :( 

So I was using 

-f ./flag -> dig '-f ./flag'

so It wasnot considered as an argument 

so 

-f./flag -> dig -f./flag

and I got the flag

It was nice Challanges I really wanted to solve all of them but I Got joined late XD and Hope you enjoyed reading this writeup.
